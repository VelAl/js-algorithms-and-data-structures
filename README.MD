# 🚀 Learning Algorithms and Data Structures with JavaScript

This project is dedicated to studying fundamental algorithms and data structures through the lens of JavaScript.

## 🎯 Project Goal

- ✅ Implement basic and essential algorithms.
- 📚 Best understand how data structures work.
- 🧪 Gain practical skills in testing using the Jest library.

## 🔍 What’s Implemented

- 🔢 Core algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching, etc.)
- 🗂️ Data structures (lists, stacks, queues, trees, etc.)

### 🛠️ Technologies

- 💻 JavaScript (ES6+)
- 🧰 Jest — for writing and running tests
